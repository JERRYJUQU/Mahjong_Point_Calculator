# Mahjong_Point_Calculator
Mahjong is a traditional Chinese board game played by 4 players with a set of 144 tiles. Each player start with receiving 13 tiles. Players draw and discard one tile in turns, and win by complete a legal hand. According to the Competition Mahjong rules, a legal hand must consist atleast 8 points to win. Since there are more than 80 ways to score and I have a very bad calculation skills, I build this application to help me calculate Mahjong points.   
The detailed rules are listed at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahjong_Competition_Rules
